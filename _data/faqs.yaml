The building department legally has 20 business days after submittal to issue the permit, however this process does not normally take this long unless there are incompletions with the application. If there are comments from any of the subcode officials these will be communicated promptly to the applicant.

Once the permit is approved the applicant will receive a phone call to pick up and pay for the permit. The permit will be issued when and only when the permit is paid for. After payment is received, the project may commence.

The applicant will receive a placard to be placed in a location easily visible from the street, such as a front window.

Plans, if any, must be kept at the site at all times. This is so the inspector can compare the work being conducted to the approved plans. Please note that the inspector will not conduct an inspection without those plans on site.

For a more detailed view of any and all requirements please see the UCC Construction Official Commentary: https://www.state.nj.us/dca/divisions/codes/publications/pdf_licensing/co_comment.pdf"
