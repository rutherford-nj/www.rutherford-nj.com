    - heading: "What is the ordinance of placing a shed on my property?"
      text: "A shed is an accessory structure and must meet those requirements. A shed can be a maximum of 200 sq. ft. and only requires a zoning permit unless a slab is required, in which case the building section of UCC application will be submitted along side zoning. Set back: The shed must be setback 3’ from the side and rear property line. The shed must be 10’ away from any other structures on the property and cannot exceed 10% of the lot size.

    - heading: "Homeowners & existing commercial tenants"
      text: "Some questions we will ask:
o What type of work is being done?

o Is this a single family/multifamily/commercial property?

· A construction Permit Application will be given to the applicant and this must be filled out completely before we can take it in.

· If the job requires it, two signed and sealed sets of sketches, drawings, plans, as well as any other documentation of the proposed work will be submitted for review along with the permit applications.

· Plans will not be reviewed without the applications alongside"
    - heading: "Other items to note for permit process:" 
      text: "The applicant must wait for permit approval to start any work.

The building department legally has 20 business days after submittal to issue the permit, however this process does not normally take this long unless there are incompletions with the application. If there are comments from any of the subcode officials these will be communicated promptly to the applicant.

Once the permit is approved the applicant will receive a phone call to pick up and pay for the permit. The permit will be issued when and only when the permit is paid for. After payment is received, the project may commence.

The applicant will receive a placard to be placed in a location easily visible from the street, such as a front window.

Plans, if any, must be kept at the site at all times. This is so the inspector can compare the work being conducted to the approved plans. Please note that the inspector will not conduct an inspection without those plans on site.

For a more detailed view of any and all requirements please see the UCC Construction Official Commentary: https://www.state.nj.us/dca/divisions/codes/publications/pdf_licensing/co_comment.pdf"
