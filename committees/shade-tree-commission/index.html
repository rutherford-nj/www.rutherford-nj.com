  <div><strong>Mission Statement:</strong></div>
  <div>
    The Borough of Rutherford Shade Tree Commission promotes the conservation and stewardship
    of trees throughout the Borough by advising and working with Borough officials, the
    Department of Public Works and Shade Tree Division regarding the planting,
    care and maintenance of public property trees. It is our heritage, responsibility
    and commitment for a long term investment in the beauty, health and character
    of our tree canopy throughout Rutherford.

    As part of this yearâ€™s Arbor Day celebration, the Rutherford Shade Tree Commission coordinated the planting of a
    large Linden tree at Borough Hall, in honor of long-time resident Marianne Coston. Marianne was a great supporter
    of the Brough of Trees and for the care and protection of the historic tree canopy in which she spent her life.
    She advocated the re-establishment of a Shade Tree Commission, and had great encouragement for the citizens who
    devoted their time and resources to its relaunch. - Video by Alex Fiume
