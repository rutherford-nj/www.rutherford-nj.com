Dr. Obropta will explain about the benefits of rain barrels, rain gardens, pervious pavements, cisterns, and other means of reducing stormwater runoff.  He will also discuss the green infrastructure feasibility study that has been completed for Rutherford and some of the potential projects that have been identified.
