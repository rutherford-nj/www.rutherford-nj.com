title: FREE Composting Workshop 6/2

---

**A free one-hour backyard composting workshop will be offered by the Rutherford Green Team at the Rutherford Community Garden, West Erie and Grand Avenues in Rutherford, at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday June 2.** 


Rutherford resident Brian Hanson-Harding, author of Composting:  Turn Food Waste into Rich Soil, will explain the do's and don't's of backyard composting, explaining how to turn kitchen scraps, yard waste, paper, cardboard, and a number of other waste items into rich brown compost that will enhance garden soil and reduce landfill waste.  He will demonstrate how the garden's own composter works and will distribute informational handouts.  He will also explain how to compost indoors and will have an indoor composting system on display. 


The Borough will have on hand a supply of its backyard composters that it sells at the discounted price of $40.00.  Rutherford residents interested in purchasing one of the limited supply may do so by bringing a check to the workshop.  They can either take them home that day or the Borough will deliver them during the following week.

 

Rain date will be Sunday, June 3 at 10:00 a.m.
