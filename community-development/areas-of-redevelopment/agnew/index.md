# Agnew Place Area A *"The Triangle"*

![Map of Agnew Place Area A](agnewamap.jpg)

**Location:** Agnew Place Area A *"The Triangle"* Between West Erie and Union Avenues

**Project Type:** Residential with Retail Space

**Project Status:** 

The triangle encompassing the Borough’s former DPW site as its base and coming to a point at the nexus of Erie and Union Avenues was included in the original “redevelopment zone” and subsequently incorporated into a designated area in need of redevelopment in 2016.  The two-part redevelopment plan adopted in April of 2019 identified the triangle parcels as Agnew Area A. This original plan allowed for up to 6 stories with 140 residential units with onsite parking and accessory retail.
