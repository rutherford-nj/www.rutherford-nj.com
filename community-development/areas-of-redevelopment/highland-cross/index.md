# Highland Cross Warehouse/Light Industrial Development

![Map of 106 Park Ave](map.jpg)

**Location:** Eastern end of Highland Cross

**Project Type:** Warehouse/Light Industrial

**Project Status:** Construction to begin Fall of 2020

The Highland Cross area east of Route 17 and located primarily within the zoning authority of the NJSEA has been under consideration for more than 20 years.  At 26 plus acres, it was, for several years considered suitable for residential mixed-use development. Residents and elected officials understandably had concerns about creating another Rutherford across route 17. 

The complexities brought on by the failed Encap development, the housing bubble, the Great Recession, and the American Dream project all served to delay development. In 2017 NJSEA in coordination with the Borough deemed the area unsuitable for residential development clearing the way for the recently approved NJSEA Redevelopment Plan allowing for Warehouse/Light Industrial with no residential development. It is anticipated that construction will begin in fall of 2020.
