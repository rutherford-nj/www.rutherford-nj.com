**What does Redevelopment mean?**

The Redevelopment Process is a tool available to municipalities allowing them to deliberately and with the input of the public determine if a property is underutilized and should have new allowable uses that cause the property to be productive.  

**What is a PILOT?"**

PILOTs are used in redevelopment projects in order to attract redevelopers by offering an alternative to conventional ad valorem taxes.

Redevelopment projects are frequently unable to attract private investment without assistance from the local government entity in the form of PILOT agreements or, in some cases, bond financing.

The combination of risk associated with redevelopment projects and uncertainty of conventional taxes make marginal projects difficult to finance.
