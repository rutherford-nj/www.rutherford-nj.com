# COVID-19 Information

March 3rd, 2020

Message from Mayor Frank A. Nunziato:

The Borough continues to closely monitor the evolving worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus
(COVID-19). Because the health and safety of each member of our community are of the utmost
importance, we want to keep you informed about the virus and any impact it may have on our
community.  

Today myself, Council President Tom Mullahey, Councilwoman Stephanie McGowan, Police
Chief John Russo, Board of Health Official Brian O'Keefe, OEM/EMS Coordinator Mike
Tarantino, Borough Administrator Bob Kakoleski and Board of Education Superintendent Jack
Hurley participated in a Coronavirus Preparedness Briefing call hosted by Governor Phil Murphy
and Commissioner Judith Persichilli, Chair of the Governor’s Coronavirus Taskforce. The
purpose of the call was to provide an update on New Jersey’s efforts in response to the
Coronavirus outbreak.

The main points of information from the call were:   

1. there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in the state; 

2. the risk of contracting the virus in  New Jersey remains very low;  and

3. the scope of testing for the virus for people who display symptoms has been expanded

Despite the limited risk, the state is developing plans and a response should the need arise. The
Borough is following that approach in developing a response strategy that includes reviewing
and preparing to implement existing plans if needed.
