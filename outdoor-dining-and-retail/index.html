  When dining out, it is strongly recommended that you make reservations so that our restaurants can better prepare for
  their
  evening. Please remember that business owners, staff and patrons are all creating a new normal as this chapter of
  reopening
  begins. Be respectful and patient with each other!</p>
<p>
  The Rutherford Police Department is requesting no bicycles within the closed roadways with dining areas. If you need
  to bring your bicycle into the event, you will be asked to walk it. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
