          The Rutherford Recreation Department is committed to providing our residents both the young and
          young-at-heart, with programs that foster a sense of community, sportsmanship and well-being.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          If you or your child participates in any in-person program sponsored by the Recreation Department we are
          requiring the family to notify the Recreation Department immediately if they have been made aware that anyone in their
          household has received a positive COVID test. If you or your child has been notified that you’ve been in close
          contact with someone who has tested positive, you are required to quarantine for 14 days before returning to
          Borough activities.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Any family who fails to notify the Borough of a positive test within their household, or anyone
          deemed jeopardizing public health, will have all members of their household suspended from
          recreational activities sponsored by and/or associated with the Borough for one year.
          The safety of our residents is always our first concern. We are all in this together!
