The Walk Rutherford trail system was created by Jessica Clancy as a part of her Girl Scout Gold Award, as a way for citizens to enjoy the towns scenery while also getting exercise and keeping track of their mileage. 

The digital maps of the trail system have been added permanently to [Recreation Department web page](/departments/recreation/) and the link can be found in the gold bar or [via the direct link here.](/departments/recreation/walk-rutherford/)

The trail system consists of three trails:

* The Blue Trail = 1 mile
* The Red Trail = 2 miles
* The Green Trail = 3 miles

Examples of each of the three signs can be found around town. Follow the appropriate colored signs that are located along the streets of Rutherford. Turn in the direction in which the arrows on the signs point, and enjoy!
