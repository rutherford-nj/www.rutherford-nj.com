Mayor DeSalvo and Councilmembers Goldsack and Smith met with representatives of the Shade Tree Commission and Green Team to discuss weed control and maintenance of the borough tree nursery.  A consensus was reached that an organic, corn gluten, pre-emergent weed control product will be applied to the boroughâ€™s tree nursey instead of a chemical based product.
