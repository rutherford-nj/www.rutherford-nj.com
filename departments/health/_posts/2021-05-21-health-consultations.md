title: "One-on-One Health Consultations"

---

The Rutherford Health Department is pleased to report that as a result of borough hall being re-opened to the public, the continuation of the health consultation/blood pressure screening program will take place by appointment only at the Health Center, 184 Park Avenue. 

Residents have the opportunity to meet with a registered nurse one-on-one for a confidential health and lifestyle assessment. One of the public health nurses will review your health history, evaluate blood pressure, cardiovascular, nutrition, height and weight, diabetic education, exercise, medication, and stress management. Health risk factors can be discussed with the nurse, along with appropriate referrals and resources if necessary on a regular basis. 

Please call the public health nurses weekdays at 201-460-3020 for more additional information and for making an appointment.
