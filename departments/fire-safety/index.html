    The Bureau of Fire Safety's primary responsibility is the enforcement of the NJ Uniform Fire Code in all commercial and multi-family buildings. The Bureau of Fire Safety is also responsible for the cause and origin investigation of all fires that occur and coordination of any serious fires that occur with other cooperating departments and agencies.
  </div>
  <div>
    Other responsibilities include administration of the Fire Department's Knox-Box entry system, completing all fire incidents reports and filing all NFIRS reports with the NJ State Fire Marshal's Office. Site plan reviews of all proposed construction projects are completed and reviewed with the Fire Department, comments and conditions are recommended to local Planning and Zoning Boards.
  </div>
  <div>
    The Bureau of Fire Safety investigates all complaints received from civilians and other borough departments and outside     agencies and appropriate enforcement action is initiated when fire code violations are discovered.
  </div>
  <div>
    Each year the Bureau of Fire Safety conducts numerous public safety education programs in the schools and business           throughout our community.
  </div>
    <div>
    It is also the responsibility of the Bureau of Fire Safety to maintain the Borough's Municipal Fire Alarm Signal System (Gamewell Signal System). This system continues to provide the most direct means of transmitting fire alarm signals from protected buildings to the Fire Department point of dispatch (Police Headquarters). All borough owned buildings, all schools, all Felician University campus buildings and numerous commercial and multi-family buildings are connected to this system. This system provides a significant cost savings to those property owners utilizing the system.
