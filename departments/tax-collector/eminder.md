**"E-MINDER" IS BACK**

The Borough of Rutherford Tax Collector’s Office is pleased to announce **"E-Minder"** is back.

If you are responsible for the payment of your property taxes and are interested in receiving a generic reminder email approximately one week prior to each quarterly due date, please e-mail the Tax Collector's Office at either cmiller@rutherfordboronj.com or bfinelli@rutherfordboronj.com. Please include your name, address, e-mail address and phone number. This is for the "e-minder" only. For other Borough notifications, please go to the main page of this web-site and sign up for the [**SWIFT911 Notification System.**](/notifications/)

**The Tax Collector's Office does not have the authority to excuse interest. Failure to receive this "e-minder" will not preclude the accrual of interest if payment is received after the grace period.**

**Quarterly Tax Payments Become Due:**

* February 1
* May 1
* August 1
* November 1

There is a ten day grace period each quarter; up to and including the 10th. Should the 10th fall on a weekend or a holiday, payments will be accepted the next business day without interest. The tax payment must be received within the designated grace period; if a payment is received after the grace period, interest is retroactive to the first day of the quarter. For the correct amount due, please contact our office at 201-460-3005. 

It is the property owner’s responsibility to maintain records regarding the payment of property taxes. Receipted tax bills or cancelled checks are proof of payment.

Tax bills will not be issued when property ownership is transferred. It is the responsibility of the property owner to be aware of tax payment amounts and due dates. Individuals transferring property are requested to turn over the tax bill to the new owner at time of title transfer.


**Payments may be mailed to:**  
Tax Collector – Borough Hall  
176 Park Avenue  
Rutherford, NJ 07070
