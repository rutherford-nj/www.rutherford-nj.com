**An Overview of the Construction Permit process:**

Here is what to expect during the permit process when you are greeted in the Construction Department: 

* You will be asked what type of work you are planning to do and the address of the work site 

* Then a Construction Permit Application will be given to you and this application must be filled out completely

Examples: Who will perform the work. What work will be done. Where the work will take place and How the work will be done

Sketches, drawings, plans and other documentation of the proposed work will have to be submitted for review along with the permit applications. Plans cannot be reviewed without the applications being submitted with them. The applicant cannot do any work at this time and must wait during the review process. The majority of permit applications we process with little delays. Small projects can take 4 to 5 days and up to 8 to 10 days and sometimes longer for the larger projects, provided all the required information has been submitted. At this time you will be advised if your permit has been approved or if denied, the reasons why. If your permit is approved, you will receive a permit and will be asked to pay the appropriate fees. The construction permit is a document granting legal permission to start construction. Keep in mind you will be asked when you leave our office to post the building permit placard in a window or other prominent place at the construction site. Please keep a copy of the approved building plans on site so that they can be available for reference and the Borough Inspectors during inspections.

**The inspections are as follows: (This is when you should call)**

* The bottom of footing trenches before placement of footing, except that in case of pile foundations, inspections shall be made in accordance with the requirements of the building subcode;
* Foundations and all walls up to grade level prior to back filling;
* All structural framing and connections prior to covering with finish or infill material;
* Plumbing underground services, rough piping, water service, sewer, septic services and storm drains; electrical rough wiring, panels and service installations; insulation installations;
* Installations of all finished materials, sealings of exterior joints; plumbing piping, trim and fixtures; electrical wiring, devices and fixtures; mechanical systems equipment;.

**Arranging inspection visits:**

**Please call the Construction Department Monday â€“ Friday 8:30 to 4:30 at (201) 460-3010**

**Try to call at least 48 hours prior to the time the inspection is desired.**
The person responsible for the construction project must request and call for inspections in advance. Inspections will be performed within three business days of the time for which they are requested. The work must not proceed in a manner, which will preclude the inspections and the work may not proceed until the inspections have been conducted and approval given. If an inspector finds that some work does not conform to the approved plans, the inspector will advise that the situation must be remedied. If the violation is serious, a Stop Work Order may be posted until the problem is resolved and an additional inspection will be required. When the construction project is completed and all inspections have been conducted and approved, a Certificate of Approval may be issued. This is a formal document, which marks the completion of the project and gives you permission to occupy or use the space. You will now have completed the Construction Permit process. We look forward to seeing you prior to the start of your next project.
