### INSPECTION PROCESS & PROCEDURE:

The inspections are as follows: (This is when you should call)

· **Building:** The bottom of **footing** trenches before placement of footing, except that in case of pile foundations, inspections shall be made in accordance with the requirements of the building subcode; **Foundations** and all walls up to grade level prior to back filling; All structural **framing** and connections prior to covering with finish or infill material;

· **Plumbing:** Underground services, rough piping, water service, sewer, septic services and storm drains;

· **Electrical:** Rough wiring, panels and service installations; insulation installations;

· **Fire:** Installations of indoor sprinkler systems, fire alarm systems (Smoke detectors), and oil tank removal

· **Final:** Installations of **all finished materials,** sealings of exterior joints; plumbing piping, trim and fixtures; electrical wiring, devices and fixtures; mechanical systems equipment.

### Arranging inspection visits:

**Please call the Construction Department between Monday – Friday 8:30 to 4:00 at (201) 460-3010**

**Please call at least 48 hours prior to the time the inspection is desired.**

Inspections will be performed within three business days of the time for which they are requested, unless otherwise notified. Ensure the inspections follow the correct order (for example, roughs come before framing). If the work does not conform to the approved plans, the inspector may issue a violation and a Stop Work Order may be posted until the problem is resolved. When the construction project is completed and all inspections have been conducted and approved, a Certificate of Approval or a Certificate of Occupancy will be issued. This is a formal document, which marks the completion of the project and gives you permission to occupy or use the space. You will now have completed the Construction Permit process. We look forward to seeing you prior to the start of your next project.
