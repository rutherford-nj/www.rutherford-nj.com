# An Overview of the Construction Permit process

## Building Permits

### When are they required?

Generally, you need to obtain a building permit from the Borough whenever you construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, remove, improve, convert, or demolish a building or other structure. A building could be anything from a tool shed to a house. Additionally, code violations are generally required to obtain a permit to correct violations including minor property maintenance violations. A Building Permit may include building, grading, plumbing, mechanical and electrical permits. The City processes the various permit types required as one total package. If you have a question about permit requirements for your project, call the Building & Safety Division at 781-7180.

### What to expect during the permit process:

Some questions we will ask:
* What type of work is being done?
* Is this a single family/multifamily/commercial property?
* A construction Permit Application will be given to the applicant and this must be filled out
completely before we can take it in.
* If the job requires it, two sets of sketches, drawings, plans, as well as any other
documentation of the proposed work will be submitted for review along with the permit
applications.
* Plans will not be reviewed without the applications alongside.

This chart is to show what work the dwelling owner can do.

### Other items to note:

The applicant must wait for permit approval to start any work.

The building department legally has 20 business days after submittal to issue the permit, however this process does not normally take this long unless there are incompletions with the application. If there are comments from any of the subcode officials these will be communicated promptly to the applicant.

Once the permit is approved the applicant will receive a phone call to pick up and pay for the permit. The permit will be issued when and only when the permit is paid for. After payment is received, the project may commence.

The applicant will receive a placard to be placed in a location easily visible from the street, such as a front window.

Plans, if any, must be kept at the site at all times. This is so the inspector can compare the work being conducted to the approved plans. Please note that the inspector will not conduct an inspection without those plans on site.

For a more detailed view of any and all requirements please see the [UCC Construction Official
Commentary](https://www.state.nj.us/dca/divisions/codes/publications/pdf_licensing/co_comment.pdf).

## INSPECTIONS

### The inspections are as follows: (This is when you should call)

* The bottom of footing trenches before placement of footing, except that in case of pile foundations, inspections shall be made in accordance with the requirements of the building subcode;
* Foundations and all walls up to grade level prior to back filling;
* All structural framing and connections prior to covering with finish or infill material;
* Plumbing underground services, rough piping, water service, sewer, septic services and storm drains; electrical rough wiring, panels and service installations; insulation installations;
* Installations of all finished materials, sealings of exterior joints; plumbing piping, trim
and fixtures; electrical wiring, devices and fixtures; mechanical systems equipment;.

### Arranging inspection visits:

**Please call the Construction Department between Monday – Friday 8:30 to 4:00 at (201) 460-3010**

**Please call at least 48 hours prior to the time the inspection is desired.** The person responsible for the construction project must request and call for inspections in advance. Inspections will be performed within three business days of the time for which they are requested. The work must not proceed in a manner, which will preclude the inspections and the work may not proceed until the inspections have been conducted and approval given. If an inspector finds that some work does not conform to the approved plans, the inspector will advise that the situation must be remedied. If the violation is serious, a Stop Work Order may be posted until the problem is resolved and an additional inspection will be required. When the construction project is completed and all inspections have been conducted and approved, a Certificate of Approval may be issued. This is a formal document, which marks the completion of the project and gives you permission to occupy or use the space. You will now have completed the Construction Permit process. We look forward to seeing you prior to the start of your next project.
